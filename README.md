# Membership-Registration-Google-Form
A Google Form that charges a user a specific price based on which membership they choose to register for. Implemented using Payable Google Form add-on and Stripe to collect payment. Sends the user a copy of their responses (if requested), updates a Google Spreadsheet in live time, validates phone number (10 digits) and email address before allowing submission. This form is currently in TEST mode and will display fake credit cards to try once submitted.
